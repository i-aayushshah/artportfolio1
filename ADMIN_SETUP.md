## üõ†Ô∏è API Testing

### Authentication Endpoints
```bash
# Sign In
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@sujalart.com","password":"Admin@1234"}'

# Forgot Password
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/forgot-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@sujalart.com"}'
```

### Admin Endpoints (Require Bearer Token)
```bash
# Get Artworks
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/admin/artworks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Add Artwork
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/artworks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test Art","description":"Test Description","image":"https://example.com/image.jpg"}'

# Upload Image

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. MongoDB Connection Error
- Check `MONGODB_URI` in `.env.local`
- Ensure IP is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas
- Verify database name in connection string

#### 2. JWT Authentication Error
- Check `JWT_SECRET` in `.env.local`
- Clear localStorage and login again
- Verify token format in API requests

#### 3. Email Not Sending
- Check SMTP credentials in `.env.local`
- Use Gmail App Password, not regular password
- Verify EMAIL_HOST and EMAIL_PORT settings

#### 4. Admin User Not Found
- Run `npm run create-admin` again
- Check MongoDB for users collection
- Verify admin credentials

### Development Tips

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Check Network Tab**: Verify API responses
3. **Check Server Logs**: Monitor console for server errors
4. **MongoDB Compass**: Use GUI to inspect database collections

## üì± Mobile Responsiveness

Test admin panel on different screen sizes:
- Desktop (1920x1080)
- Tablet (768x1024)
- Mobile (375x667)

All admin features should be fully functional on mobile devices.
